# Binary Matrix Maze Solver

This program written in C solves binary matrix mazes using a rat that can only move right and down. It provides the flexibility to either input a custom maze or generate a random maze. The solution is found using a recursive backtracking algorithm.

## Features
- Input custom binary matrix mazes
- Generate random binary matrix mazes
- Find the path from the starting point to the ending point
- Visual representation of the maze and the path

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `maze_solver.c` file using a C compiler.
3. Execute the compiled program.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the maze size, starting and ending coordinates, and choose between user input or random maze generation.
5. The program will display the maze and the path of the rat.
